# Iris Dataset Data Science Project

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the famous Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset used for pattern recognition and machine learning tasks. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and visualize the data to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the species of iris flowers.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in the `data` folder of this repository. It is also available in many machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn (`sklearn.datasets.load_iris`).

### Features
- **Sepal Length** (in cm)
- **Sepal Width** (in cm)
- **Petal Length** (in cm)
